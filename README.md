Overview of the Project

Project: Predictive Modeling With Linear Regression On Salary Dataset

**Objective**

The Objective of this analysis is to predict salary based on years of experience using a linear regression model. We first explore the data then split it into training and testing sets, fit the model, and evaluate its accuracy.

Key Activities

1. **Load Data**: Read the salary data from a file.

2. **Explore Data**: Check the first few rows to see what the data looks like.

3. **Prepare Data**: Separate the data into experience (input) and salary (output).

4. **Visualize Data**: Create a scatter plot to see how experience relates to salary.

5. **Split Data**: Divide the data into training and testing sets.

6. **Train Model**: Use the training data to teach a model how experience predicts salary.

7. **Make Predictions**: Predict the salary for a given number of years of experience.

8. **Evaluate Model**: Check how well the model predicts salaries using the test data.
